# 🖐️ Hi, I'm Peter — Aspiring QA Engineer/Software Tester (ISTQB Certified)

Welcome to my GitHub portfolio!

I'm sharing what I've learned--and continue to learn--through a music learning app project that allows me to explore software testing strategies; inspiring me to break things beautifully so users don't have to.

## 📘 What I've Learned

- Manual testing techniques & writing effective test cases
- Testing fundaments and strategies:
  - Black box testing (Equivalence Partitioning, Boundary Value Analysis, Decision Table Testing, State Transition Testing, etc.)
  - White box testing (Statement Testing, Branch Testing)
  - Experience-Based Test Techniques (Error Guessing/Fault Attack, Exploratory Testing, Checklist-Based Testing)
- Automation tools like Selenium
- Testing with Azure DevOps
- Git & GitHub for version control
- API testing fundamentals
- Performance testing with JMeter
- Agile methodologies & SDLC
